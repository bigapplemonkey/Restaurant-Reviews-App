# Restaurant Reviews App

In this project, we incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. We take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. We also add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users.


## Functionality

- Responsive grid-based layout using CSS; all responsiveness is done with CSS.
- Use of CSS Grid Layout to accomplish responsiveness.
- Media queries that provide fluid breakpoints across different screen sizes.
- Responsive images that adjust for the dimensions and resolution of any mobile device.
- Accessibility features in the site HTML.
- ServiceWorker script to cache requests to all of the siteâ€™s assets so that any page that has been visited by a user will be accessible when the user is offline
